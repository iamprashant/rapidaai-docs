</Step>

<Step title="Testing Knowledge Retrieval">
Your assistant can now access the selected knowledge sources when responding to user queries. When a user asks a question related to your knowledge base, the assistant will:

1. Automatically detect when knowledge retrieval is needed
2. Query your knowledge sources for relevant information
3. Incorporate retrieved information into its response
   </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Knowledge Tools

You can modify or remove the Knowledge Retrieval Tool at any time by returning to the Tools tab in your assistant's manage tab. This allows you to:

- Add or remove knowledge sources
- Temporarily disable knowledge retrieval
- Remove the tool entirely if no longer needed

By effectively configuring knowledge retrieval, your assistant can provide more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information to users based on your organization's specific knowledge resources.
