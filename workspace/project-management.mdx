## Overview

In Rapida, projects are the cornerstone of organization. Each project serves as a container for various resources and activities. An organization can have multiple projects, each with its own set of permissions and collaborators.

![Project Listing](/images/workspace/project-management.png)

The project listing page displays all projects within your organization. Key elements include:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for each project
- **Date Created**: Project creation date
- **Your Role**: Your specific role within each project
- **Collaborators**: Visual representation of team members involved

## Project Structure

Each project in Rapida can contain:

1. **Assistants**: AI helpers tailored to project needs
2. **Logs**: Activity records specific to the project
3. **Endpoints**: Project-specific API endpoints
4. **Knowledge**: Dedicated information repositories

## Project Permissions

Permissions in Rapida are project-based, allowing for granular access control:

- **Super Admin**: Full access and control over the project
- **Admin**: Manage project resources and collaborators
- **Member**: Contribute to and use project resources
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to project data

### Key Points:

- Permissions are set at the project level, not organization-wide
- A user can have different roles in different projects
- Organization admins can manage projects but don't automatically have access to all project data

## Managing Multiple Projects

Organizations in Rapida can host multiple projects:

- Each project is isolated from others
- Resources and permissions don't overlap between projects
- Users can be part of multiple projects with varying roles

## Best Practices

- Clearly define project scopes to avoid overlap
- Regularly review and update project permissions
- Use descriptive project names for easy identification
- Leverage project-specific resources for targeted workflows

Remember, while your organization may have numerous projects, each project operates as its own ecosystem within the Rapida platform.
