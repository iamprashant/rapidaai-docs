## Getting Started

To integrate VoyageAI with your Rapida application, follow these steps:

# Supported Models

VoyageAI offers a range of embedding models that can be used with this integration. Here's a table of the supported models:

| Model Name              | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| voyage-2                | General-purpose embedding model                           |
| voyage-code-2           | Specialized embedding model for code-related tasks        |
| voyage-finance-2        | Embedding model optimized for financial applications      |
| voyage-large-2          | Large-scale general-purpose embedding model               |
| voyage-large-2-instruct | Instruction-tuned version of the large embedding model    |
| voyage-law-2            | Embedding model tailored for legal and law-related tasks  |
| voyage-multilingual-2   | Multilingual embedding model supporting various languages |

These embedding models offer various capabilities and are optimized for different domains. Choose the appropriate model based on your specific use case and requirements.

Note: These models are specifically designed for generating embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They are particularly useful for tasks such as semantic search, clustering, and recommendation systems.
