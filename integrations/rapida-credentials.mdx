## Types of Rapida Credentials

Rapida provides two distinct types of credentials:

1. **Project Credentials**: These are project-specific keys used to authenticate and interact with the Rapida service for a particular project.
2. **Personal Tokens**: These are personal access tokens used to authenticate and interact with the Rapida service across all your projects.

## Project Credentials

Project Developer Keys are used to authenticate and interact with the Rapida service for a specific project. They are essential for SDK integration, widget implementation, and certain API calls.

### Accessing and Managing Project Credentials

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Project Credentials">
Go to the "Integration > Project-Credential" page in your Rapida dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="View Project Developer Keys">
You'll see a list of existing Project Developer Keys, each labeled as a "Publishable Key" with its expiration date.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Credential (Optional)">
To generate a new key:
- Look for the "Create new credential +" button at the top right of the page.
- Click this button to automatically generate a new Publishable Key.
- The new key will appear in the list with its expiration date.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage Existing Keys">
For each Publishable Key, you can:
- View the partially hidden key (click the eye icon to reveal)
- Copy the key (click the copy icon)
- See the expiration date
</Step>
</Steps>

Note: These are project-specific keys. They are used to authenticate and interact with the Rapida service for this particular project, as stated in the information banner at the top of the page.

## Personal Tokens

Personal Tokens are used to authenticate and interact with the Rapida service across all your projects. They provide broader access and are typically used for administrative tasks or when working across multiple projects.

### Accessing Personal Tokens

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Personal Tokens">
Go to the "Integration > Personal-Credential" page in your Rapida dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="View Personal Token">
You'll see your personal access token, which includes:
- Authorization
- X-Auth-Id
- Project ID
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

- Keep all credentials (both Project Credentials and Personal Tokens) secure and never share them publicly.
- Use different Project Credentials for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Regularly rotate your credentials, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
- Use Personal Tokens cautiously, as they provide broader access across your projects.

By understanding and properly utilizing both types of Rapida credentials, you can ensure secure and efficient integration with the Rapida platform across various use cases and projects.
