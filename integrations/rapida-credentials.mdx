## Getting Started

To create and use Rapida credentials for your project, follow these simple steps:

## Creating Rapida Credentials

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Project Credentials Page">
Navigate to the "Integration > Project-Credential" page in your Rapida dashboard. Here you'll see a list of existing Project Developer Keys, if any.
</Step>
<Step title="Create New Credential">
  To create a new credential:
  - Look for the "Create new credential" button (usually represented by a "Create new credential +" icon) at the top right of the page.
  - Click this button to generate a new Project Developer Key.
</Step>

<Step title="Credential Generation">
  The system will automatically generate a new Publishable Key for your project.
  You don't need to input any information manually.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify New Credential">
After creation, you'll see the new credential added to your list of Project Developer Keys. It will display:
- The key name (always "Publishable Key")
- The generated key value
- Creation date
- Status (should be "Active")
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Rapida Credentials

Your newly created Rapida credential (Publishable Key) can be used for:

1. **SDK Integration**: Incorporate the key when initializing the Rapida SDK in your applications.
2. **Widget Implementation**: Use the key to authenticate and load Rapida widgets in your web projects.
3. **API Calls**: Include the key in your headers when making API calls to the Rapida platform.

Remember, these credentials are associated with your specific project in the Rapida platform, ensuring secure and scoped access to resources.

## Important Notes

- Keep your Publishable Keys secure and do not share them publicly.
- You can create multiple keys for different environments or purposes (e.g., development, staging, production).
- If a key is compromised, you can easily create a new one and deprecate the old key for security.

By following these steps, you'll have a Rapida credential ready to use across various integration points with the Rapida platform.
