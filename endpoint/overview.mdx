## What are Endpoints?

An endpoint is a specific URL or access point that allows your application to interact with an LLM. It's essentially the gateway through which you can send requests to the model and receive responses.

## Key Use Cases

Endpoints can be utilized in various ways to enhance your application's capabilities:
