## Benefits

- Simplified Key Management: Use just one key provided by Rapida, eliminating the need to manage multiple provider keys.
- Enhanced Security: Use Project Scoped or Organization Scoped keys with additional restrictions.
- Prevent Bypass: No need to distribute any provider keys directly, which could let users bypass our valuable logging and monitoring.
