The Rapida Voice AI Platform provides multiple deployment options to run your voice AI agents in production environments. Understanding these options helps you make the right choice for your specific use case.

Rapida Voice AI Platform supports two primary deployment modes:

- **Rapida Managed**: Fully managed platform service hosted on cloud infrastructure
- **Self-Hosting**: Self-managed deployment on your own infrastructure (EC2, Docker Kubernetes, etc.)

## Rapida Managed

Rapida Managed is a fully-managed, globally distributed network of Rapida servers that provides all the power of the open-source platform with none of the operational complexity. It allows you to focus on building your voice AI applications while Rapida handles deployment, scaling, and maintenance.

- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No need to manage servers, containers, or scaling
- **Automatic Scaling**: Built-in load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities
- **High Reliability**: Enterprise infrastructure with automatic failover
- **Managed Updates**: Automatic security patches and feature upgrades
- **Regional Deployment**: Choose from multiple global regions to optimize latency
- **Built-in Monitoring**: Integrated metrics, logging, and health monitoring

Best for: Teams that want to focus on agent development rather than infrastructure management.

## Self-Hosting (EC2, Docker, or Custom Infrastructure)

Self-hosting gives you complete control over your deployment environment and infrastructure. When self-hosting:

- **Full Control**: Complete control over hardware, networking, and configurations
- **Custom Integrations**: Ability to integrate with existing infrastructure and tools
- **Data Localization**: Maximum data security for high-compliance environments
- **Custom Resource Allocation**: Optimize for your specific performance requirements
- **Custom Scaling**: Implement your own scaling strategies and resource management

Best for: Organizations with specific infrastructure, security compliance requirements.

## Why Choose Rapida Managed?

- **Zero operational overhead**: No need to manage servers, scaling, or infrastructure.
- **Global edge network**: Users connect to the closest server for minimal latency.
- **Unlimited scale**: Support for high volume of concurrent calls with our distributed architecture.
- **Enterprise-grade reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantee with redundant infrastructure.
- **Comprehensive analytics**: Monitor usage, performance, and quality metrics through the Rapida dashboard.
- **Same APIs and SDKs**: Use the exact same code whether you're on Rapida Managed or self-hosted.

Rapida Managed runs the same open-source servers that you can find on GitHub. It provides the same APIs and supports all of the same SDKs. An open-source user can migrate to Rapida Managed, and a Rapida Managed customer can switch to self-hosted at any moment. As far as your code is concerned, the only difference is the URL that it connects to.

## Comparing Rapida Managed to Self-hosted

When building with Rapida, you can either self-host the open-source server or use the managed Rapida service:
