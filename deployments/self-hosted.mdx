Choose the self hosted deployment method that best suits your infrastructure and requirements:
- [Local/VM (Docker Compose)](#local%2Fvm-docker-compose) - Quickest way to get started

## Local/VM (Docker Compose)

### Requirements

- Git
- Docker & Docker Compose → use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Mac or Windows
- Minimum 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 30GB storage
- Internet connection for initial container pulls


### Deployment Steps
1. **Clone the Rapida Voice AI Platform repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rapida/rapida-voice-ai.git
   cd rapida-voice-ai
    ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
    ```
   Edit .env file with your configuration settings

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
    docker compose up

4. **Monitor Startup**
   ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

    Watch the containers being started and the logs flowing in. After about 2-3 minutes, the rapida-voice-ai container should log "Ready". At this point you can proceed to the next step.

5. **Access the Platform**
    Open your browser and navigate to
    http://localhost:3000

### Common Issues
- **Port Conflicts**: If you see errors about ports already in use, modify the port mappings in your .env file
- **Resource Limitations**: Increase Docker's resource allocation if containers fail to start
- **Network Issues**: Ensure Docker has proper internet access to pull container images
